In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Executes the express server with nodemon (`nodemon index.js`).


### `npm run start`

Starts the **REACT** dev server **ONLY**, good to make all the changes you want on the front before building the project to serve it with express 

### `npm run seed`

Seeds the database
